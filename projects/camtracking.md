title: "Camera Tracking and Pose Estimation"

### [GitHub Link](https://github.com/PSRahul/camtracking)

The project aimed to find the pose and position of a visually feature-rich object from a series of images.

In the first task, the positions of the rotating camera, indicated by the blue arrow need to be figured out using Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.

PnP Algorithm uses the correspondences between the real world dimensions of the boxes and the pixel position of the visible corner of the boxes in the image.
