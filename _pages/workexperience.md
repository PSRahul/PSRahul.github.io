## Working Student and Master Thesis - Machine Learning Team
 
### [PreciTaste](https://precitaste.com/) 

October 2021 - December 2022

+ Led the project to automate finding the positions of object corner points in an image using a deep learning-based
segmentation network. Conducted a thorough literature review and set up data, training, and evaluation pipelines using
PyTorch for fast prototyping.
+  Responsible for coordinating data annotation and model maintenance for a customer deployment. Achieved 95 percent
precision on object detection models.
+ Developed a web app using Plotly, Dash, and Pandas for visualizing experimental data.

## Working Student / Intern- Video Analytics Team
 
### [IPS Intelligent Video Software, Securiton Germany](https://ips.securiton.de/en/index.html) 

July 2021 - September 2021

+ Built data and training frameworks for studying the feasibility of deep learning-based solutions for pedestrian detection
in videos.
+ Managed automated data annotation efforts of 5000+ images and set up data pipelines using SQL to retrieve data
querying on object categories.
+ Performed exhaustive experiments with models such as the Tensorflow API on GPU cluster for multiple parallel model
training. Additionally, designed metrics to balance the speed of inference and accuracy of the models.

## Student Teaching Assistant - Technical University of Munich
 
### [Introduction to Deep Learning (I2DL)](https://niessner.github.io/I2DL/) 

November 2020 - March 2021

+ Responsibilities include holding office hours and supporting preparation of programming exercises.

## Graduate Engineering Trainee
 
### [Ashok Leyland](https://www.ashokleyland.com/in/en)
