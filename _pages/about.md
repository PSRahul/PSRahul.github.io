Hello,

I recently completed my master's program in Computational Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Munich. The last two years were filled with incredible learning in ML, AI, and computer vision culminating in my master's thesis on Object Detection with Limited Labels. In collaboration with PreciBake GmbH, this thesis investigated various techniques to train ML models in limited data scenarios.

I am now looking for amazing full-time opportunities in machine learning, data science, and computer vision. Feel free to connect with me for any possible leads or positions.

My email address is psrahul.ml(at)gmail.com
