Hello,

I'm a Machine Learning Developer with TUV Rheinland and a recent graduate from the Technical University of Munich, specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning. With approximately 2 years of hands-on experience in developing machine learning production systems, I've honed my skills in end-to-end machine learning design. My expertise encompasses every stage of the machine learning lifecycle, from crafting robust data pipelines to model selection and training, designing effective metrics, and creating efficient inference processes. I'm also well-versed in deploying models to modern architectures.

I am actively exploring new opportunities for full-time positions in machine learning in India. If you have any leads or positions that align with my skill set, I would love to connect. Feel free to reach out to me via email at psrahul.ml(at)gmail.com.
